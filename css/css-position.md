# CSS Positioning

`position: static|absolute|fixed|relative|initial|inherit;`

    static 	Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow
    absolute 	The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element
    fixed 	The element is positioned relative to the browser window
    relative 	The element is positioned relative to its normal position, so "left:20" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position
