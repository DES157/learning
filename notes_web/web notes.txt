__CSS Grid__ Layout / Grid-View


css:
[class*='foo-'] select 


  display: -ms-grid; /* prefix for IE 10 */
  display: grid; /* or inline-grid */


normally: width + padding + border = actual width of an element
height + padding + border = actual height of an element
  box-sizing: border-box; //padding and border are included in the total width and height of the elements, so elements stay the size you want, could be good to apply to everything in css!

 	* {
    	box-sizing: border-box;
	} 

  	-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
	-moz-box-sizing: border-box;
	box-sizing: border-box;

 



  float: left //element should be taken from the normal flow and placed along the left or right side of its container, other elements are placed like they didn't exist, which is why we clear the things after  eg can be used to make a ul horizontal by making li float left, also seems to fix when something crowds 

inline-block -> like floatcan now specify width/height,...and other along form the ride?

- inline: ignore width and height, floating turns into block element, floating elements should have width/height specified (does this also apply to floating block-level elements?)
- block-level: allows margin and padding, will expand so there are times when you won't want to set these


margin?
padding?

id vs classes

<main>/once per page and canâ€™t be used as a descendant of an <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <header>, or <nav> element. (and it's not a sectioning element!)

sections and headers, pre html5 the rule was only one h1, previously h1, etc tags implied a new section, now 
so body, then sectioning content, and the first heading tag in sectioning content is the label for tha tsection, note outside of sectioning elements headings are still interpreted as start of new section.





sectioning root = can have its own outline, but the sections and headings inside it does not contribute to the outline of its ancestor

0. body - special case
1. blockquote
2. figure
3. td
4. details
5. dialog
6. fieldset
7. ...?

4 sectioning elements (define "content sections"):

1. article (html5)
2. section (html5)
3. nav (html5)
4. aside (html5)


headers and footers mark up content within
